- Run the spejsView.py Python script in terminal or any other program which will run Python
- Input URL of desired website
- Enter refresh rate (wait time before next refresh)
- Enter amount of views (amount of refreshes you want to perform)

**NOTE:** This was just for fun and should not be used to fake views for monetisastion reasons such as ad views etc.

The code is not perfect so any tidying up or fixing is much appreciated :)
